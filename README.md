## A News Feed Application

- This repository contains a working solution to a front-end application that takes advantage of the functionalities NewsAPI provides. - The application is similar to a modern RSS feed that allows you to view all headlines from different news sources and link to the original articles/news on those sources. 
- The application is written in React with the following features;
  Login via Google
  Allow users select news sources
  Allow users sort news article based on its following sorting options (Top or Latest)
  Allow users read a news article in-app and from original source
  A live version of the application is deployed on heroku via here

- babel-preset-es2015, babel-preset-react, babel-preset-stage-2 - These packages provide Babel presets for React plugins, es2015 plugins, stage 2 plugins.
- css-loader: The css-loader is used with webpack and it interprets @import and url() like import/require()
- express: Used as the web server for this application
- flux: It enables the app to implement the flux architecture
- moment: Used to format date and time
- node-sass, sass-loader: These enable the app to use sass (.scss) directly in scripts
- node-env-file: Parse and load environment files
- react: It enables the app to use the React architecture
- react-router-dom: DOM bindings for React Router
- extract-text-webpack-plugin: A webpack plugin to extract text from a bundle, or bundles, into a separate file.
- webpack: Used to bundle the app's js and scss files for usage in the browser

# Development Dependencies
- jest: For JavaScript testing
- babel-jest: Used to automatically compile JavaScript code using babel.
- enzyme: Enzyme is used together with mocha, chai and expect.js to test this application
- eslint: This is a javascript syntax highlighter used to highlight syntax errors during the development of this app
- eslint-config-airbnb, eslint-plugin-import, eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y, eslint-plugin-react: These are ESLint packages containing all of ESLint rules and they are used in this application to define rules and highlight errors
- react-test-renderer: This package provides two React renderers that can be used for testing purposes:
 Test renderer: Renders React components to pure JavaScript objects without depending on the DOM or a native mobile environment
 Shallow renderer: Shallow rendering lets you render a component "one level deep" and assert facts about what its render method returns, without worrying about the behavior of child components, which are not instantiated or rendered
- sinon: Used for mocking React components during test
- webpack-dev-server: A development server that provides live reloading.
